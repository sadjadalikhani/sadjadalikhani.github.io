I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University where I work with Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb in the Wireless Intelligence Lab. My research focuses on building large wireless models, multimodal digital twins, and dataset similarity tools that enable practical generalization across communication and sensing tasks.

I currently lead the Large Wireless Model (LWM) effort, which spans scalable data generation pipelines, sparse spatio-temporal attention architectures, and transfer evaluation suites. I also collaborate closely with industry partners—most recently with Nokia Bell Labs—to translate these ideas into deployable prototypes for environment-aware networks.

## Research interests

- Foundation models for wireless channels and spectrograms
- Digital twin calibration for channel estimation, spectrum sharing, and sensing
- Dataset similarity metrics for communication and sensing workloads
- Mathematical optimization, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning

## Highlights

- Released the LWM arXiv preprint and public benchmark suite for universal wireless feature extraction.
- Co-organized the 2025 ITU × ASU LWM multi-task optimization challenge, supporting 65 global teams and evaluating all submissions.
- Built a multi-modal, city-scale wireless dataset pipeline during my Nokia Bell Labs internship to pretrain environment-aware foundation models.

## Collaboration

I am always interested in teaming up on large-scale wireless datasets, evaluation benchmarks, or practical deployments of digital twin-guided communication systems. Email is the best way to reach me, and you can also find me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sadjadalikhani">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sadjadalikhani">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/wi-lab">Hugging Face</a>.
